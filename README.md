# GIDS Open Standaarden legal documents
This repository contains legal documents relevant for SamenBeter and GIDS Open Standaarden. We believe legal documents should also have a proper open source license so they can be shared, reused by relevant organisations and can be adapted to local needs. So all legal documents of GIDS Open Standaarden are licened 'Creative Commons, Share-alike, by' (CC-SA-BY 4.0) and published here on GitHub. Hints on using these documents:
* Mark each document with a copyright notice and with "cc-sa-by 4.0"
* When changing the document keep the original copyright notice, but add a 'contributions by: [name]' section. If there is already such a section, add your name to it.
* Use angular brackets, '[]', to mark clearly what parts of the document needs to be filled in when using it. If one field is used on several places in the document, make sure to use one and the same name for that field, so people can sue search and replace to use it.
